# Deprecation Warning

This project was started at the advent of the Redux ecosystem, and was intended to help users get up and running quickly. Since then, tooling and best practices have evolved tremendously. In order to get the most modern experience possible, I recommend checking out something like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) which is supported by many core React and Redux developers.

You are welcome to use this project if it is a better fit for your needs, but if you are brand new to the ecosystem I highly recommend checking out something that has received more recent updates.

Thank you to everyone who made this project possible over the past year(s).
